# AlumniManagementSystem
Alumni Management System for school
Helps the school keep track of their alumni, including contact information, career updates, and contributions. Features event planning tools, fundraising campaigns, and networking opportunities. Allows alumni to update their profiles, connect with peers, and engage with current students.
This way, the school can still reach out to them.
